<h1 style="font-size:32px;font-weight:bold;color:#eeffcc;font-family:微软雅黑">Short Bio</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Hello, this is Zhenlin Wu! I worked as a HPC engineer in Baidu Paddle-Lite mobile GPU group in the past year, mainly focusing on optimizing the OPs and framework's performance with adaptive input-shape on various mobile hardwares. I have 3 years of working experience in industry since 2019. Previously, I spent one year in Dept. of ECE at University of Massachusetts at Lowell for research and study, with my focus on High Performance Graph Computing. Prior to that, I received my Master's degree in Pure Mathematics from Capital Normal University and my Bachelor's degree in Information and Computing Science (Applied Mathematics) from Beijing Jiaotong University.

Generally speaking, my research interests span across the full computer system stack, including parallel algorithms, runtime systems, compilers and hardware architectures. It’s an exciting time to be a computer architect and I hope to get chance to work on architectural changes to future general-purpose hardware accelerators like GPUs.
